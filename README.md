Welcome to the repository for my thesis project: **Design and Development of a Communications Protocol for the Pehuensat III picosatellite**, which is part of the ongoing space program at the Universidad Nacional del Comahue in Neuqu√©n, Argentina.

This thesis project is being conducted to fulfill the requirements for the Electronic Engineering degree at the Faculty of Engineering, Universidad Nacional del Comahue.

Here, I will be sharing the project's code, as well as the final thesis document once it's complete, to document both the process and the outcomes.
